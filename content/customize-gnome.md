The GNOME desktop environment is highly customizable.  With a few extensions, the desktop can look and feel like many other operating system's desktops.  Launcher bars can be added, window lists can be used, and the overall look and feel of the desktop can be changed.

To install a customization, simply head to [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org) to install, remove, and configure currently installed customizations.  A web browser plugin is needed to interact with the site, and it will prompt for installation if needed.  Remember to refresh the page after the plugin is installed.

There are many extensions to choose from! If one isn't currently working, or breaks with an update, then try a different extension to see if it works better.
