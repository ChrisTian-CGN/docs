## Before We Begin

### 1. Do you have a current backup of your files?

Depending on how time sensitive your issue is, the fastest resolution may be to reinstall the operating system. Re-imaging is much easier to do if we know that your important files are safe.

We have a help article on backing up your system [here](/articles/backup-files)

### 2. Do you have a Live USB drive with a copy of either Ubuntu or PopOS available in case we need to use it as a rescue disk?

This will provide us an outside OS environment to access your installed system, potentially rescue files that have not been backed up, or quickly reinstall the OS if necessary.

We have a help article on creating [Live USBs here](/articles/live-disk)

## Common Issue Sources

### Software

We have an article for troubleshooting software issues [here](/articles/software-triage)

### Environment

#### 9. Are any other machines or users in your home or workspace experiencing the same issue?

#### 10. If the issue involves networking, have you tried resetting your modem/router?

 **NOTE:** Please try this again, even if it appears no other devices are affected.

#### 11. Are there any devices in proximity with your system that could be causing Wi-Fi or Bluetooth interference?

#### 12. Is your work environment a stable temperature or has it been particularly warm or cold lately?

#### 13. Have you added any external devices or accessories to your machine and workflow lately?

#### 14. Has the machine ever suffered any fall or liquid damage?
