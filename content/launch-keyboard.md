The keys are defined in the firmware of your keyboard and you can remap the keys using the <u>Keyboard Configurator</u>. You can download the `AppImage` for Ubuntu and download it from the <u>Pop!\_Shop</u> on Pop!\_OS. Use the link below to download the application.

https://github.com/pop-os/keyboard-configurator/releases 

After opening the <u>Keyboard Configurator</u>, you can then select the key you would like to configure, and select an item from the available items below the keyboard showing in the application. I am attaching a video showing the remapping process. Please note the "Layer 1" and "Layer 2" at the top of the configurator. Layer 1 is what the keys will do normally, then Layer 2 shows what the keys do when "Fn" is held down.
