## What is Kernelstub?

### Overview

> Kernelstub is a utility to automatically manage your OS's EFI System Partition (ESP). It makes it simple to copy the current kernel and initramfs image onto the ESP so that they are automatically probeable by most EFI boot loaders as well as the EFI firmware itself. It can also set up the system's NVRAM to add entries to the firmware boot menu for the kernel (and keep these options up to date when new kernel versions are installed).

From the `kernelstub` [Github page](https://github.com/isantop/kernelstub)

Developed by System76, `kernelstub` is included with Pop!\_OS to manage kernel settings and boot files with `systemd-boot`. The `.deb` file can be downloaded on Github [here](https://github.com/isantop/kernelstub/releases) along with source code. `kernelstub` is designed to make working with `systemd-boot` easy to work with.

## Common Uses

The benefit of `kernelstub` is the ease with which kernel options and boot parameters can be managed. You can be quickly added (or remove) options that are used by the Linux kernel on boot. 'kernelstub' will make sure to only have a sinlge instance of options added.

For example, this makes adds both "quiet" and "splash" to the kernel options:

```bash
sudo kernelstub -o "quiet splash"
```

A full set of available options are listed on the Github page. They can also be printed out in the Terminal by passing:

```bash
sudo kernelstub --help
```

Most of the options available have short and long-form options. Output of the `--help` produced at the time of this writing is included [below.](#help-output)

## Troubleshooting

`kernelstub` is also a useful troubleshooting tool, allowing quick changes to kernel options used on boot.

### Verbose Output

To see more detailed information about what `kernelstub` is doing, add the `-v` or `--verbose` flags to your command. To save the output to a log pass the `-g` or `--log-file` flags followed by the save location:

```bash
sudo kernelstub -g ~/kernelstub.log
```

This command creates a log of `kernelstub` output and saves it in the `Home` folder.

### "Dry Run" and Return Codes

To see if a command will do something intended or something harmful, you can run `kernelstub` with a "dry run" instruction added.

```bash
sudo kernelstub --dry-run
```

If your dry run yields errors, you can look up the error codes [here](https://github.com/isantop/kernelstub#return-codes) and adjust accordingly.

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Drive Latency Changes

If a system exhibits drive, or drive power issues, the drive may not be correctly resuming from suspend. Drive latency can be adjusted using `kernelstub`.

Finding the latency settings from the drive controller to limit the drive from the deepest drive states can be found from the following commands:

```bash
# make sure smartclt is installed
sudo apt install smartmontools
sudo smartctl -a /dev/nvme0n1
```

and then can be set with a `kernelstub` command like this:

```bash
sudo kernelstub -a "nvme_core.default_ps_max_latency_us=1200" 
```

### Cstate Changes

Likewise, CPU performance or power issues can be mitigated by changing C-state settings.

```bash
sudo kernelstub -a "intel_idle.max_cstate=4"
```

### Backlight Controls

Kernelstub can be used to change ACPI settings for backlight control in the event of function keys misbehaving.

```bash
sudo kernelstub -a "acpi_backlight=vendor‚Äù
```

### `--help` Output

```bash
user@pop-os:~$ kernelstub --help

                  [--root-path ROOT] [-k PATH,] [--kernel-path PATH]
                  [-i PATH,] [--initrd-path PATH] [-o "OPTIONS",]
                  [--options "OPTIONS"] [-a "OPTIONS",]

  -p, --print-config    Print the current configuration and exit
  -e ESP,
  --esp-path ESP        Manually specify the path to the ESP. Default is

  --root-path ROOT      The path where the root filesystem to use is mounted.
  -k PATH,
  --kernel-path PATH    The path to the kernel image.
  -i PATH,
  --initrd-path PATH    The path to the initrd image.
  -o "OPTIONS",
  --options "OPTIONS"   The total boot options to be passed to the kernel
  -a "OPTIONS",
  --add-options "OPTIONS"
                        Boot options to add to the configuration (if they
                        aren't already present)
  -d "OPTIONS"
  --delete-options "OPTIONS"
                        Boot options to remove from the configuration (if
                        they're present already)
  -g LOG
  --log-file LOG        The path to the log file to use. Defaults to
                        /var/log/kernelstub.log
